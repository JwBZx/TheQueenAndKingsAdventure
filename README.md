# TheQueenAndKingsAdventure
Welcome to TheQueenAndKing'sAdventure, a simple "Choose Your Own Adventure"-like game that is all about The Queen (one of my best friends in the entire world: Laura) and The (Loser) King (me)!
It is a fun game that I have started on my own, but maybe can finish with her (which would be awesome)!

I hope you like this game, and also this project/repository!
If you have any comments, questions, or ideas, feel free to open up an issue or fork the project and work on it yourself!

Thank You and God Bless!
